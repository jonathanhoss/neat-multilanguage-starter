# Neat Multilanguage Starter

Starter Template for **N**etlify CMS, **E**leventy, **A**lpine JS & **T**ailwind CSS

Fork from [Neat Starter](https://github.com/surjithctly/neat-starter)

Added Multilanguage Support with the [EleventyI18nPlugin](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/i18n/).

In Decap CMS (former Netlify CMS) the same Posts in different Languages need to have the same filename to enable easy switching between Languages.

For a post available in English and German, the shared filenames in Decap CMS would be:

English: example-post
German: example-post

- [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/)
- [Alpine.js](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine)
